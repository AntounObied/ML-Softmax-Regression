# ML-Softmax-Regression
This program uses softmax regression to train a model for multiclass classification based on a set of samples, with 4 features per sample.

To train the model, run with the following command line argument:

train

This will use the iris_train.dat file to train the model with optimal parameters.


To predict, run with the following command line argument:

predict

This will use the iris_model to predict the samples present in the iris_test.dat file, and calculate the accuracy of the model
